## REQUIREMENTS:
### ●	System - Windows 7 or higher, 1 GB RAM.

## PROCEDURE:

## Assembly of Polar 3D Printer
### 1.	Select 'Assembly of Polar 3D Printer' from the visible list.
### 2.	All the parts related to Polar 3D Printer will be shown on the screen.
### 3.	Select the parts in sequence in which they are shown.
### 4.	When the first part is selected then it will open in the blank space in the left side of the screen.
### 5.	Further, when the correct part will be selected then it will get assembled with the previously selected part/parts.
### 6.	If the user follows an incorrect sequence then a pop-up will appear on the screen showing the name of the part to be selected.

## Playing with Axes
### 1.	Move the r-axis slider and observe the movement of the r-axis assembly.
### 2.	Move the y-axis slider and observe the movement of the y-axis assembly.
### 3.	Move the z-axis slider and observe the movement of the z-axis assembly.

#### Y-AXIS BASE :
The base of the printer that supports the rest of the components.

####  Z-AXIS FRAME :
This is the frame that holds the print head and moves it up and down along the vertical axis.

#### SMOOTH RODS :
These smooth rods provides guideways for the extruder assembly to traverse up and down.

#### MOTORS :
This motor is responsible for the movement of the bed support along with the base plate.

#### EXTRUDER SUPPORTER :
Extruder holder holds the extruder and traverses vertically during the printing process.

#### THREADED ROD :
Specifications of threaded rods:- M5 The threaded rods provide the path for the movement of the x-axis assembly along the z-axis. The threaded rods are coupled with motor using the couplings. The nut is inserted in the x-axis assembly which moves up and down and carries the x-axis assembly with it SMOOTH RODS Number of plane rods=2 Diameter of rods=8mm Length of Rods=42cm These rods provide the smooth path and support for the movement of the x-axis assembly.

#### Y-AXIS FRAME :
Y-Axis Frame supports and carries base plate assembly.

#### MOTOR WITH GEAR :
It is a motor mounted with a gear to transmit motion through gears.

#### MOTOR-WITH-PULLEY :
It is a motor mounted with pulley to transmit drive through the belts.

#### GEARS :
Gear is a power transmission element used to transfer driving force.

#### PLATE :
plate where the printed object is created.

#### EXTRUDER :
Extruder is the core of any 3D printer. It heats up the filament and extrudes it with the help of a nozzle.

#### FILAMENT :
Filament is the material which is to be 3D printed.

## Output:

### Name: P.Pradeep Raj
### Register Number: 212222240073

## Result: 
### Thus the simulation on construction of polar 3D printer is completed & movement of axis along X, Y, & Z has been studied.
